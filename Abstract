This project introduces a robust music recommendation system utilizing a relational database 
management system (DBMS) for enhanced user experience. It incorporates personalized 
recommendations based on user preferences, listening history, and collaborative filtering 
techniques. The architecture comprises optimized database schema, user interface, and 
recommendation algorithms. Through testing, the system showcases its ability to provide 
relevant recommendations, with future plans for advanced machine learning integration and 
API incorporation.
