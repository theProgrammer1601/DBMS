Hardware Requirements :-

1. Sufficient RAM: The amount of RAM depends on the size of your database and the 
complexity of your recommendation algorithms. At least 8GB of RAM is recommended for 
smaller databases, but more may be needed for larger datasets.

2. Powerful CPU: A multi-core processor will help handle the computational load of 
processing and analyzing large amounts of data efficiently.

3. Storage: Adequate storage space for storing the music metadata and user preferences. 
Consider using SSDs for faster read/write operations.

Software Requirements :-

1. Database Management System: Choose a DBMS that supports efficient storage and 
retrieval of data, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.

2. Programming Language: Choose a programming language like Python, Java, or Scala for 
implementing recommendation algorithms and integrating them with the DBMS.

3. Recommendation Algorithms: Implement collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, 
or hybrid recommendation algorithms based on your requirements.

4. Web Framework (optional): If you plan to build a web-based application, you may need a 
web framework like Django, Flask, or Node.js for developing the user interface and 
integrating it with the recommendation system.

5. APIs and Libraries: Utilize libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for 
implementing machine learning models and APIs for integrating external data sources like 
music metadata and user interactions.
