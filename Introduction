In our digital age, finding the right music can be overwhelming. That's where music 
recommendation systems come in. This project explores how we can use a database system 
to create a personalized music recommendation experience. By understanding your tastes and 
using smart algorithms, this system aims to suggest songs you'll love, making your music 
discovery journey easier and more enjoyable. This introduction sets the stage for our 
exploration into building an effective music recommendation system using 
database technology.
